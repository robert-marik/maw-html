We use gettext and hence it is pretty simple to translate all messages in
MAW. To translate MAW you have to add translation to text strings located in two .po
files. English po files (en_US.po) are good start for this task.

<li> <a href="http://bitbucket.org/robert.marik/maw-html/src/tip/locale/">Input forms</a> (English skeleton, translations into Catalan, Czech and Polish)

<li> <a href="http://bitbucket.org/robert.marik/maw/src/tip/locale/">Server side applications</a> (English skeleton, translations into Catalan and Czech)

There is an <a href="http://user.mendelu.cz/marik/entrans">online application Entrans</a> for translators. 
You may revise current translations or start new translation. 
You may create your own account, or use the username translator and the same password.

Currently Polish, Catalan, French, Czech, English, Chinese, Russian, German are installed, two files for each language. 
We can add new languages on demand. 

If you update translations, let me know at the address    marik at mendelu dot cz
You may also send the po file for your language by email or ask to add your language into our web based translation application.
